## ChatCommands - BepInEx plugin for commands via chat

If you've ever had to use a single console command a lot during a game, im sure you hated opening the console too.

So, here it is.

Console commands, per chat. (That's all it does, i promise)

### What works:
####Calling registered commands
This plugin checks for registered console commands, and if the command is registered, runs the command via call to the
console. So, as long as your favourite mod adds actual console commands, this mod will work with it with no extra
configuration required.

####Status response
This is not the actual console response, but the response from a pre-execution check. Still, you get a response if I
think you should be able to run the command (based on flags).

### What doesn't (yet):
####Console output in chat
If i ever find a nice solution to this problem, it will be added.
